# Bitsery ESP-IDF Component

This is a simple wrapper around fraillt's fast and tiny binary serialization library [Bitsery](https://github.com/fraillt/bitsery) so that you can use it with the [ESP-IDF Component Manager](https://github.com/espressif/idf-component-manager).

Due to its small footprint and concise binary representation, Bitsery is a good choice for serialization on the ESP32.
